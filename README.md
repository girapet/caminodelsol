## Camino Del Sol
A local solar time clock for mobile devices

### Presentation
You are shown a circle representing a 24-hour day.  The top of the circle is noon, the bottom is midnight, the left side is morning and the right side is afternoon and evening.  A dot representing the sun slowly moves around the circle marking the time of day.  

Different shades of blue represent differences in daylight.  Starting from the bottom, the darkest blue is night, followed by the lighter blue of morning and evening twilight, with the light blue of sunlight at the top. Twilight in this context is [civil twilight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight#Definitions_and_illustrations_by_illumination) during which there is enough daylight for normal daytime operations.

### Location and Time Awareness
The clock shows the proportions of daylight, twilight and night for the  location of your mobile device and the current time of year.  In the mid-latitudes the day will be noticeably shorter than the night in winter and longer in summer.  The clock will properly display 24 hours of day or night at the highest latitudes.

### Time and Duration Display
The entire face of the clock is touch-enabled.  Tap once to display data and again in the same spot to turn the display off.  Times are formatted for the current locale as either 24-hour or AM/PM.

#### Times
Tap on the circle for the following in the current time zone.
* __Midnight__ (solar) - bottom

* __Sunrise__ - near the left transition from twilight to daylight
* __Noon__ (solar) - top
* __Sunset__ - near the right transition from daylight to twilight
* __End Twilight__ - near the right transition from daylight to twilight

#### Durations
Durations in hours and minutes are displayed when tapping inside or outside of the circle.  Taps on the left side include twilight when calculating total daylight.  On the right twilight is included with night, thus day is only the hours of actual sunlight.
