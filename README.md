## Camino Del Sol
A local solar time clock for mobile devices

### Presentation
You are shown a circle representing a 24-hour day.  The top of the circle is noon, the bottom is midnight, the left side is morning and the right side is afternoon and evening.  A dot representing the sun slowly moves around the circle marking the time of day.  

Different shades of blue represent differences in daylight.  Starting from the bottom, the darkest blue is night, followed by the lighter blue of dawn (left) and dusk (right), with the light blue of sunlight at the top.  In this context dawn and dusk are the times of [civil twilight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight#Definitions_and_illustrations_by_illumination) during which the sun is not visible but there is enough daylight for normal daytime activities.

### Location and Time Awareness
The clock shows the proportions of daylight, dawn, dusk and night for the location of your mobile device and the current time of year.  In the mid-latitudes the daylight hours will be noticeably shorter than the night in winter and longer in summer.  The clock will properly display 24 hours of day or night at the highest latitudes.

### Time and Duration Display
The entire face of the clock is touch-enabled.  Tap once to display data and again in the same spot to turn the display off.  Times are formatted for the current locale as either 24-hour or AM/PM.
